# About Me
:wave: Hi, I am Iván Rodríguez and I am a Computer Engineer since 2018 by Granada University in Spain.
I want to improve and develop new skills so I'd like to share my projects with the Github community 
because I think that it is the best way to keep in touch with the knowledge.

I am working at Atlax360 and here I am a software analyst.

Now, I am software developer in ASP.Net EcoSystem with technologies like:

:star::star::star: SQL Server

:star::star::star: C#

:star::star::star: Integration Services SSIS

:star::star::star: Net Core

:star::star: Net WCF

:star::star: Azure Devops

:star::star: Azure EcoSystem

:point_right: I am currently focused on Python :snake:, Docker, Microservices, AI

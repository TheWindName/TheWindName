# About Me
Hi, I am Iván Rodríguez and I am a Computer Engineer since 2018 by Granada University in Spain.
I want to improve and develop new skills so I'd like to share my projects with the Github community 
because I think that it is the best way to keep in touch with the knowledge.

I am working at Atlax360 and here I am a software analyst.

Now, I am software developer in ASP.Net EcoSystem with technologies like:

- SQL Server
- C#
- Net WCF
- Net Core
- Integration Services SSIS
- Azure Devops
- Azure EcoSystem

, so
